Plan: Attendance API & Lecturer Dashboard for Yooh

  This plan outlines the development of a backend API for storing attendance data and a web-based dashboard for lecturers to monitor student attendance.

  1. High-Level Architecture

  The final system will consist of three main components:

   1. Yooh iOS App (Existing): The app will be updated to send attendance data to our new backend API instead of (or in addition to) storing it locally.
   2. Backend API (New): A Node.js server that will receive data from the iOS app, store it in a database, and provide data to the admin dashboard.
   3. Admin Dashboard (New): A web interface for lecturers to log in, view, and analyze student attendance data.

  Data Flow:
  iOS App -> Backend API -> Database <- Admin Dashboard

  2. Proposed Technology Stack

   * Backend: Node.js with Express.js. It's a popular, fast, and relatively simple framework for building APIs.
   * Database: PostgreSQL. A robust and reliable open-source relational database that is perfect for handling structured data like attendance records.
   * Admin Dashboard: React.js. A powerful library for building modern, interactive user interfaces. We'll use a component library like Material-UI or Ant Design to create a
     professional-looking dashboard quickly.
   * Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing the API endpoints and managing user sessions in the dashboard.

  3. Development Phases

  I'll break down the work into four distinct phases.

  Phase 1: Backend API Development

  This is the foundation of the new system.

   * Setup Node.js Project: Initialize a new Node.js project with Express.js.
   * Database Schema Design: Define the structure for our data. We'll need tables for:
       * users (to store student and lecturer information, including roles).
       * classes (for school classes/courses).
       * enrollments (to link students to the classes they are enrolled in).
       * attendance_records (to store each attendance event).
   * API Endpoint Implementation: Create the following API endpoints:
       * POST /api/auth/login: For lecturers to log in and receive an authentication token.
       * POST /api/attendance: The endpoint the iOS app will call to submit an attendance record.
       * GET /api/dashboard/attendance: A protected endpoint for the dashboard to fetch attendance data for all students in a lecturer's classes. It will calculate attendance percentages on
         the fly.

  Phase 2: iOS App Integration

   * Modify `AttendanceManager.swift`: Update the existing attendance logic. When a user signs attendance, besides the current functionality, it will make a network request to the new POST
     /api/attendance endpoint on our backend.
   * Secure API Calls: Ensure that any API keys or tokens needed to communicate with the backend are stored securely within the iOS app.

  Phase 3: Admin Dashboard Development

   * Setup React Project: Initialize a new React application.
   * Implement Login Page: Create a login form for lecturers. On successful login, the app will store the JWT and use it for subsequent API requests.
   * Create Dashboard View:
       * Fetch and display a list of students and their overall attendance percentage for the classes managed by the logged-in lecturer.
       * The list will clearly show the student's name, ID, and attendance percentage.
       * Conditional Formatting: Students with an attendance percentage below 70% will be visually highlighted (e.g., with a red background color) to make them easy to spot.
       * Add sorting and filtering options (e.g., by student name, by percentage).

  Phase 4: Additional Features (Recommended)

  To make the dashboard even more powerful, I suggest we add these features:

   * Detailed Student View: Allow a lecturer to click on a student to see a more detailed breakdown of their attendance, including which specific classes they missed and on what dates.
   * Class-Specific Filtering: Add a dropdown menu to filter the dashboard by a specific class, showing attendance for only the students enrolled in that class.
   * Reporting & Exports: An "Export to CSV" button that allows lecturers to download the attendance data for their records.
   * User Management: A section in the dashboard (perhaps for a super-admin role) to add, edit, and remove student and lecturer accounts.
   * Automated Email/Push Notifications: The system could automatically send a notification to students who drop below the 70% threshold.


   // set up the DB and run it : 
    1. Run the Backend Server

  The iOS app needs to connect to your Node.js backend API.

   * Open a terminal on your Mac.
   * Navigate to the backend directory:
   1     cd /Users/dtorredo/Code/Yooh/backend
   * Install dependencies (if you haven't already):
   1     npm install
   * Start the server:
   1     npm start
      You should see a message like Server is running on port 5001. Keep this terminal window open.

  2. Set Up the Database

  The backend needs a PostgreSQL database to store data.

   * Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your Mac.
   * Create a database for this project (e.g., yooh_db).
   * Configure your connection: Open the file backend/.env and make sure the DB_URL variable points to your database. It should look something like this:
   1     POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/yooh_db"
   2     JWT_SECRET="yourjwtsecret"
   * Create the tables: Execute the SQL commands in backend/src/models/schema.sql against your database. You can use a tool like psql or a GUI client like Postico. This will create the
     users, classes, enrollments, and attendance_records tables.

  3. Create Users and Data

  The app now has a login screen, but no way to register new users from the UI. You'll need to create at least one student and one lecturer to test the full functionality.

  You can use a tool like curl in a new terminal window to register them.

  Register a Student:

   1 curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/register \
   2 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   3 -d '{
   4   "firstName": "John",
   5   "lastName": "Doe",
   6   "email": "john.doe@student.com",
   7   "password": "password123",
   8   "role": "student"
   9 }'

  Register a Lecturer:

   1 curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/register \
   2 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   3 -d '{
   4   "firstName": "Jane",
   5   "lastName": "Smith",
   6   "email": "jane.smith@lecturer.com",
   7   "password": "password123",
   8   "role": "lecturer"
   9 }'

  4. Run the iOS App

   * Run on the Xcode Simulator (Recommended): Open the Yooh.xcodeproj project in Xcode and run it on an iPhone simulator. The app is configured to connect to localhost, so it will find the
     backend server running on your Mac automatically. You can log in with the student credentials you created.

   * Run on a Physical iPhone: If you want to run the app on your actual iPhone, you must change localhost to your Mac's local IP address.
       1. Find your Mac's IP address (e.g., in System Settings > Wi-Fi > Details).
       2. In Xcode, open AuthManager.swift and AttendanceManager.swift and replace "http://localhost:5001" with "http://YOUR_MAC_IP_ADDRESS:5001".
       3. Ensure your iPhone is on the same Wi-Fi network as your Mac.



       ////
       I have completed the migration of your application to Convex. Here's a summary of the work:

  Backend:
   * The project is now a Convex project.
   * The PostgreSQL schema has been translated to a Convex schema.
   * All backend logic has been migrated to Convex queries and mutations.

  Frontend:
   * The frontend is now connected to your Convex backend.
   * The authentication system has been updated to use Convex.
   * The login and dashboard pages now fetch data from Convex.
   * A registration form has been added to the login page.

  Here's how to run your application:

  1. Start the Backend:
      * Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory:
   1      cd backend
      * Start the Convex development server:

   1      npx convex dev

  2. Start the Frontend:
      * Open a second terminal and navigate to the Yooh/dashboard directory:
   1      cd Yooh/dashboard
      * Start the React application:
   1      npm start

  3. Register and Login:
      * Your browser should automatically open to http://localhost:3000.
      * Use the "Register" tab to create a new "lecturer" account.
      * Once you've registered, you will be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard.

  Your application should now be fully functional using Convex as the backend.


  /////
   1. Run the backend: Make sure your backend server is running (npm start in the backend directory).
   2. Update the IP address: Manually replace YOUR_MAC_IP_ADDRESS in AttendanceManager.swift and AuthManager.swift with your computer's local IP address.
   3. Run the app: Build and run the app on your iPhone from Xcode.
